 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a RESTful API using Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. RESTful APIs are widely used in web development to perform CRUD operations on resources via HTTP methods.

🚀 What is a RESTful API?
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods to interact with data:

GET – Read data

POST – Create data

PUT/PATCH – Update data

DELETE – Delete data

In this project, we’ll use these methods to handle requests and responses from a simple backend server built with Express.
